* Code creation progress for Gesture Ritual_01_
General progress: 
Stage 01: Brainstorm the key pages (e.g. title_page, instruction_page, action_page, transition_page, result_page)_ refer to Figma page (https://www.figma.com/board/splBNnHaltjQ4xOTOWBlfk/Hello-World-Final-Assignment?node-id=0-1&t=40p653GGNPAzIgFb-1)
Stage 02: Design UI pages in Figma
Stage 03: Exported elements and make animation in Adobe After Effects
Stage 04: Group all the static and animated game designs 
Stage 05: Upload all the elements to p5js

Elaboration more on stage 05:
Problems I envountered:
01. The system failed to filter the hands, especially when there were more than four hands inside the frame. The system had trouble distinguishing the main players
02. The hand key points varied according to hand size, which sometimes meant that people could not pass the design- this problem even existed now

Problem I encountered: 
01_ I tried to connect teachable machine with the p5js, and my aim is to ask the teachable machine to distinguish the bell sound and the background noise, but I failed to do so
02_ The failure leads me to try to work with p5js sound classification, and set the sound frequency to a exact amount to trigger the next pages

Problem I encountered: 
01_ I tried to use WebSerial to connect the p5js with the Arduino Nano Esp 32
02_ Sometimes I connected the
