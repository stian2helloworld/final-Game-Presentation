Concept overview   - 
This project is a web-based interactive game designed to celebrate and share Chinese cultural heritage, particularly inspired by the Nine-Colored Deer and the ancient murals of Mogao Caves in Dunhuang. The narrative follows a ritual journey to awaken the symbolic deer spirit, guiding players through a sequence of mystical interactions.
The user experience is structured around several key screens:
Title page – A poetic opening that sets the tone
Instruction pages – Background storytelling and how to play
Ritual footprint page – Overview of completed rituals
Three interactive rituals – Each uses a different form of user input (gesture, sound, and water)
Ending scene – The awakening of the deer

Purpose & Impact   -
This project is not problem-solving in a conventional sense—it is an aesthetic and emotional offering. As the creator, my goal is to evoke curiosity, wonder, and cultural appreciation among users, especially my classmates unfamiliar with Chinese myths. It’s a bridge between tradition and technology, rendered in interactive form.

Why It Matters   -
As a passionate admirer of Mogao Cave murals, this is my way of archiving and reimagining ancient art through modern tools. It is both a personal expression and a creative cultural invitation.

Target users   -
This game is for everyone—curious players, artists, cultural enthusiasts, or anyone interested in immersive storytelling experiences.



Highlights & Challenges   -
The unique challenge and charm of this game lies in its multi-sensory input design. Players must use:
Hand gestures (gesture detection)
Sound cues (ring a bell)
Water interaction (pouring water into a sensor-equipped vessel)
This makes it more than just visual—it’s ritualistic and embodied.

Collaboration & Workflow   -
Work Mode: Solo


Support: ChatGPT + reference tutorials
Visual Assets: Created with Dreamnia AI, Photoshop, Figma, After Effects
Technical Stack:
Frontend: JavaScript via p5.js
Interaction: ml5.js (hand pose), sound classification, Arduino Nano ESP32

Technical Scope   -
Key Features
Gesture detection: Custom poses required to progress
Sound interaction: Mic captures bell ringing
Water level detection: Real-world pouring interaction with sensor


Dependencies & Data
The project doesn't use traditional external datasets. However, it heavily relies on:
ml5.js handPose model; p5.js sound detection system; serial communication with Arduino (for water sensor)

Anticipated Technical Challenges   -
Machine Learning Integration: Custom gesture detection based on keypoint confidence
Hardware–Web Sync: Stable connection between p5.js and Arduino
Teachable Machine Compatibility: Browser/version dependency may block integration
Asset Optimization: p5.js file size limits may restrict animation or image quality
Most Difficult Task   -
The most difficult part is gesture detection—especially defining and confirming custom hand shapes across various users. It also involves managing real-time state transitions in p5.js and ensuring gestures trigger the correct visual/audio response.

Research Plan   -
What I Need to Learn
Fine-tuning ml5.js hand model
Calibrating sound wave sensitivity
Learning Teachable Machine–p5.js communication
Managing frame memory/efficiency in p5js


*Support I’ll Need
Instructors (Carrie etc.) for ml5 tutorials
Documentation for serial communication and machine learning
Troubleshooting browser–Teachable Machine compatibility

Feasibility & MVP   -
MVP
A functional ritual game prototype with:
At least three distinct interaction rituals
Playable title > ritual > ending loop
One physical interaction (e.g., pour water into deer sculpture)


Nice-to-Have features
Final animation of awakening the Nine-Colored Deer
Fully designed instruction UIs with animated feedback
More rituals and poetic overlays


If I run out of time...
I will reduce visual complexity and focus on interaction accuracy
Use stock visuals temporarily and refine later
Make one ritual fully polished instead of three semi-complete ones
